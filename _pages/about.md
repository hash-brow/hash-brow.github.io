Hi! I am Divyansh Garg, a junior undergraduate majoring in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. I have a deep interest in Computer Systems, Algorithms, and Machine Learning.

My academic journey has been filled with different experiences in Algorithms and Machine Learning. I have recently picked up an interest in Computer Systems, and am looking forward to explore the field further.
